I face some new think today
1. if i set md5 encryption on my code(login) and if i also set it on database password then it's work
	-> but the special think is if i don't put that encryption on database it's still ganna work
2. If i do not put any validation email on my code(html/php) and also i set it's type varchar on database but database still give error if email is not valid
